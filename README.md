📷 Project Overview
This project configures the ESP32-CAM to function as a standalone Wi-Fi Access Point. Once powered on, the device broadcasts its own Wi-Fi network. Users can connect to this network using a smartphone or computer and view the live camera feed through a web browser.​

🧾 Repository Contents
main.ino: The primary Arduino sketch that initializes the camera, sets up the Access Point, and handles HTTP requests to serve the video stream.​

camera_pins.h: A header file defining the pin configuration for the ESP32-CAM module, ensuring correct communication with the camera hardware.​

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
ESP32-CAM module​
GitHub

Arduino IDE with the ESP32 board support installed​

Installation
Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.​

Open main.ino in the Arduino IDE.​

Connect your ESP32-CAM module to your computer via USB.​

Select the appropriate board and port in the Arduino IDE:​

Board: "AI Thinker ESP32-CAM"​

Port: [Select the correct COM port]​

Upload the sketch to the ESP32-CAM module.​

Usage
After uploading, the ESP32-CAM will restart and create a Wi-Fi network named, for example, ESP32-CAM-AP.​

Connect your smartphone or computer to this Wi-Fi network.​

Open a web browser and navigate to http://192.168.4.1/.​

You should see the live video stream from the ESP32-CAM.​
